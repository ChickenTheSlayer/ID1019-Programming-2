  @doc """
  Simulates the movement of a train. Returns the tuple {k, remain, take} where remain
  and take are the wagons of train and k are the numbers of wagons remaining to have n
  wagons in the taken part.
  The wagons on the main track are in reverse order i.e. the first wagon in the list is
  in the leftmost position on the track. When youâ€™re asked to move three wagons to another
  track you should dive the train into two segments; the segment that should remain and
  the three wagons (to the right i.e. in the end of the list) that should be moved.
  ## Example
